# Code Guide - Printing Strings, Saying Things

The words we've been writing between double quotes are called
**strings**.

Think of a ```string``` as some **data** that your program knows about.
```print``` is an **action** that you can apply to that data - 
it takes the ```string``` and displays it to the **Console** when you
**Run** the program.

```run-dartpad:theme-dark:mode-inline
void main() {
	print("A string of letters!");
	print("Or numbers. Testing 123");
	print("Or emojis! 🌀🌴🐿🌈🐝");
}
```

There's a whole lot more you can do with ```strings```, but this is
enough to get you started!

In the next step we’ll explore this mysterious ```void``` called ```main```.
