# Code Guide - Void Main

Which of these two ```strings``` do you think will ```print``` to the
**Console**? Press **Run** to check your intuition.

```run-dartpad:theme-dark:mode-inline
void main() {
  print("Enter the Void ðŸŒ€");
}

void notMain() {
	print("Rainbows and unicorns ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ");
}
```

Okay, so the word **main** has some kind of special significance.

Just like you, the program needs somewhere to begin its journey. In many
programming languages, that starting point is called **main**.

But why step immediately into a **void**? 

**Programming languages** donâ€™t tend to be quite as friendly as **human languages**.
They are always **formal**. They use very technical terms, like **void**, to
indicate very specific things - in this case, the **absence of a value**. 

So... ```void``` (**no value**)...``` main``` (**name of the start point**)... **what?** 

**How do these relate?** Find out in the
Next Step, where we explore the concept of a **function**.
