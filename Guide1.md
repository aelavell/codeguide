# Code Guide - In yr Own Words
 
Replace the part that says ```CHANGE ME``` with your own words.
Hit Run and see it show up in the **Console**.
 
```run-dartpad:theme-dark:mode-inline
void main() {
  print("CHANGE ME");
}
```


Make sure the new text you write is ```"surrounded by double quotes"```, or it
won't work!
